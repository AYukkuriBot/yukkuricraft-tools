    <h1>Yukkuricraft Info</h1>
    <p>
        A collection of information so you don't have to go looking for it elsewhere.
    </p>

    <h2 id="ranks" class="scrolltarget">Ranks</h2>
    <p>
        Yukkuricraft has many different ranks. Here is a brief description of them, and what sets them apart from
        each other.
    </p>

    <h3>Public ranks</h3>
    <p>These are ranks most commonly seen on members of the community.</p>

    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Infant:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Just joined the server, has not completed the quiz. This is a new person who has not yet mentally
            involved themselves with the server or the community.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Child:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who's completed the quiz. This is the rank that people will go through during
            their first few days on the server. Children can set up to 3 homes.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Adult:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has at least a total of 4 days (96 hours) worth of activity on the server. This person has
            devoted a lot of their time on the server and is now considered an active member of the community.
            Adults and up are allowed to use items like fire and lava. Adults can set up to 5 homes.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Senior:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has at least a total of <strong>10</strong> days (240 hours) worth of activity. Can set up
            to 10 homes at once.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Elder:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            This rank represents dedication and big positive involvement with the community and staff. Elders are
            specifically chosen and voted on by the staff. If you are an Elder, that means you're a positive force
            within the community, and have been noticed for your actions. You're one of the community leaders. Inactive
            and troublesome elders can be demoted. This is mostly just a pretty title! Elders can set up to 15 homes.
        </dd>
    </dl>

    <h3>Staff ranks</h3>
    <p>
        The following list consists of the main permission-tampering ranks that are most regularly seen. These ranks
        are also allowed to hack their games so as long as they do not use the hacks for cheating in survival mode.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are also special "Titles" within the staff ranks. "Titles" are just that. Titles. They're a way to
        differentiate slightly different purposes within the same overall rank.
    </p>

    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Mediator:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has been assigned the privilege of moderating the server community. Their duty is to look
            after everyone and make sure they're on their best behavior. They are capable of building in Gensokyo
            but are not assigned to.

                <dd class="col-sm-10">A mediator with extensive historical knowledge of the Yukkuricraft community.
                    While equal to
                    other mediators, these members are respected within the staff body for having been around since
                    YC's early days (~2011) as a community.
                </dd>
            </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Youkai Builder:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has been assigned the privilege of building in Gensokyo, allowing them to modify and change
            what they deem necessary. These peeps have some real building talent, and are responsible for many of
            Gensokyo's structures.

            <br \>
            <br \>

                    builders are
                    generally willing to go the extra mile to organize and head large-scale projects for Gensokyo

            </dl>
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Sysadmin:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            These staff are responsible for the technology side of Yukkuricraft. Think server, plugins, discord
            bots, etc. While sysadmin have access to all commands and are effectively similar to admins, they do not
            outrank Yukkuri Admins in regards to the community.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Yukkuri Admin:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Yukkuri Admins are the highest roles on the server, they have access to every command and have the final
            say in decisions. These admins are entrusted to handle or oversee almost any major issue within the
            community overall and see it resolved amicably.

            <br \>
            <br \>
            <dl class="row">
                <dt class="col-sm-2"><i> The [Owner] Title</i>:</dt>
                <dd class="col-sm-10">These people have access to the serverbox and have completely control over the
                    server's
                    existence.

    </dl>

    <h3>Special ranks</h3>
    <p>
        The following ranks are special ranks that you don't see as often, but serve a purpose for specific
        circumstances.
    </p>

    <dl class="row">
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Probation:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            People who have been previously permanently banned, but are being given another chance to redeem their
            self. If this person screws up even once, they will most likely go back to being permanently banned and
            will no longer receive any chances for redemption in the future. It takes a lot to get this rank, you'd
            have to basically try to get it in order to get it.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Temp. Youkai:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has been temporarily granted permission to build in Gensokyo in order to give focus to
            specific projects without actually being a full-fledged builder.
        </dd>
        <dt class="col-sm-2">Retired:</dt>
        <dd class="col-sm-10">Someone who used to be on the staff team but is no longer.</dd>

        <dd class="col-sm-10">
            Someone who has had a large and positive impact on the server and/or the community, but no longer

    <h2 id="rules" class="scrolltarget">Rules</h2>

    <p><em>Rules are accessible in-game through /rules</em></p>

    <h3 id="rulesGR" class="scrolltarget">GENERAL RULE-SET[GR]</h3>
    Rules that apply across all of Yukkuricraft
    <ol class="decimal">
        <li>
            <p>Be courteous and respectful</p>
            Keep an open mind on the server and respect that others may see things differently to you. Do not engage in
            toxic behavior. In this server, toxicity is defined as intentional actions of a non-humorous nature aimed at
            causing distress or emotional/social harm towards others. Continuing toxic behavior will lead to proper
            punishment.

            In addition, continuous aggravating/annoying behavior directed towards a significant part of the server,
            that stretches or comes close to breaking server rules, will be treated as toxic behavior.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Respect staff</p>
            Staff members volunteer their time in order to support the server. Please give staff members the same
            courtesy and respect you offer towards others both online and offline, and remember that they attempt to
            consider all issues and disputes from as objective a viewpoint as possible. Staff members have the final say
            on most server matters.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Do not ero-rp (Erotic Roleplay)</p>
            Do not link to NSFW material or engage in NSFW behavior in public channels. Furthermore, do not engage in
            activity that is illegal in your nation and/or the USA while on Yukkuricraft. The server has and will
            collaborate with authorities if any illegal activity is discovered in it.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Do not ask for promotions</p>
            Promotions to staff are administered as per the server's requirement. The highest non-staff rank attainable
            is Elder, which is obtained by being a continuing positive contributor to the server's social development.
            Demanding a promotion will impact poorly on your character.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No account fraud/Ban evasion</p>
            Any attempts at ban evasion, account stealing/hijacking, or otherwise impersonating another community member
            for personal gain or any other reason will result in a permanent ban.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No Soliciting</p>
            Unwarranted solicitations, attempts at spam, or inappropriate self-advertisement are not allowed.
            Aggressively or constantly nagging people about something you want them to do or join will not be tolerated.
            This rule is more strict on those not involved with the community, so spacing your advertisements out will
            not keep you clear of violating this rule if it's the only thing you do with us.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>SlOw RiDe TaKe It EaSy</p>
            At the end of the day, we're all just here to enjoy ourselves. The rules, while not concrete and are subject
            to change or working around if necessary, are simply put here to protect the good people and keep out the
            bad. So, please, remember to have fun and take it easy.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="rulesSR" class="scrolltarget">SERVER RULE-SET[SR]</h3>
    Rules that apply mostly to the Minecraft server.
    <ol class="decimal">
        <li>
            <p>Do not grief</p>
            Griefing or stealing of items is strictly prohibited, aside from consensual activity with friends.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Do not PvP</p>
            Unwarranted attacks against non-consenting players is forbidden. Dueling or ambushing your friends is fine,
            but hunting strangers and other non-consensual PvP is not.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Do not cheat</p>
            Do not use any software or exploits that may result in you gaining an unfair advantage over other players.
            Minimaps and waypoints, however, are permitted.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Be mindful when building</p>
            Builds that conflict with the existing environment, or are obviously low-effort, will be removed where
            appropriate.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Don't abuse events and resources</p>
            Intentionally manipulating or exploiting server events and resources to gain material and items is illegal.
            This includes but is not limited to the likes of massive farms, bots, and/or exploiting event areas for
            drops.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3 id="rulesDR" class="scrolltarget">DISCORD RULE-SET[DR]</h3>
    Rules that apply mostly to the Discord server
    <ol class="decimal">
        <li>
            <p>Be mindful of your microphone</p>
            If your sound quality is poor, please use the TTS role to communicate. Excessive hot-mic (constant
            microphone activity, such as background noise or your breathing/chewing/etc) may also result in you being
            requested to use the role. In general, please be courteous and don't constantly disturb the flow of
            conversation, whether the problem is hardware, software, or yourself. Continuing offenders will be warned
            and potentially banned.
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No NSFW without consent</p>
            If all members of a room with a temporary chat channel consent to viewing NSFW material, NSFW material can
            be posted. However, once a new member joins the room the process must be repeated. NSFW anywhere else, apart
            from NSFW channels, is prohibited.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Closing notes</h3>
    Remember that communication is vital to a healthy community. Most problems can be easily resolved by talking it out,
    rather than starting drama or trying to get someone banned over nothing. Staff are here to help, not be contracted
    hit-men for whomever you currently dislike. Treat your fellow member with the same respect you'd like for yourself
    and remember to take it easy.

            private: you can also allow other users or groups to access the block as well. This is done by adding them
            after "private". You can add more than one group and/or user per command. When you prefix a User or Group
            with an '@', this User/Group will be able to modify the block and add other users. They cannot disable the
