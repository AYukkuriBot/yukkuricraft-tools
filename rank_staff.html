	<h2 id="ranks">Ranks</h2>
	<p>
		Yukkuricraft has many different ranks. Here is a brief description of them, and what sets them apart from each
		other.
	</p>

	<h3 id="public-ranks">Public ranks</h3>
	<p>These are ranks most commonly seen on members of the community.</p>

	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Infant:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Just joined the server, has not completed the quiz. This is a new person who has not yet mentally
			involved themselves with the server or the community.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Child:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who's completed the quiz. This is the rank that people will go through during
			their first few days on the server. Children can set up to 3 homes.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Adult:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has at least a total of 4 days (96 hours) worth of activity on the server. This person has
			devoted a lot of their time on the server and is now considered an active member of the community.
			Adults and up are allowed to use items like fire and lava. Adults can set up to 5 homes.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Senior:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has at least a total of <strong>10</strong> days (240 hours) worth of activity. Can set up
			to 10 homes at once.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Elder:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			This rank represents dedication and big positive involvement with the community and staff. Elders are
			specifically chosen and voted on by the staff. If you are an Elder, that means you're a positive force
			within the community, and have been noticed for your actions. You're one of the community leaders. Inactive
			and troublesome elders can be demoted. This is mostly just a pretty title! Elders can set up to 15 homes.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3 id="staff-ranks">Staff ranks</h3>
	<p>
		The following list consists of the main permission-tampering ranks that are most regularly seen. These ranks
		are also allowed to hack their games so as long as they do not use the hacks for cheating in survival mode.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are also special "Titles" within the staff ranks. "Titles" are just that. Titles. They're a way to
		differentiate slightly different purposes within the same overall rank.
	</p>

	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Mediator:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has been assigned the privilege of moderating the server community. Their duty is to look
			after everyone and make sure they're on their best behavior. They are capable of building in Gensokyo
			but are not assigned to.

			<br \>
			<br \>
			<dl class="row">
				<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2"><i>The [Advisor] Title</i>:</dt>
				<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">A mediator with extensive historical knowledge of the Yukkuricraft
					community.
					While equal to
					other mediators, these members are respected within the staff body for having been around since
					YC's early days (~2011) as a community.
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Youkai Builder:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has been assigned the privilege of building in Gensokyo, allowing them to modify and change
			what they deem necessary. These peeps have some real building talent, and are responsible for many of
			Gensokyo's structures.

			<br \>
			<br \>
			<dl class="row">
				<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2"><i>The [Lead] Title</i>:</dt>
				<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">Builders with this title are designated as the "heads" of the bunch.
					These
					builders are
					generally willing to go the extra mile to organize and head large-scale projects for Gensokyo
				</dd>
			</dl>
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Sysadmin:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			These staff are responsible for the technology side of Yukkuricraft. Think server, plugins, discord
			bots, etc. While sysadmin have access to all commands and are effectively similar to admins, they do not
			outrank Yukkuri Admins in regards to the community.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Yukkuri Admin:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Yukkuri Admins are the highest roles on the server, they have access to every command and have the final
			say in decisions. These admins are entrusted to handle or oversee almost any major issue within the
			community overall and see it resolved amicably.

			<br \>
			<br \>
			<dl class="row">
				<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2"><i> The [Owner] Title</i>:</dt>
				<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
					These people have access to the serverbox and have completely control over the
					server's existence.
				</dd>
			</dl>
	</dl>

	<h3>Special ranks</h3>
	<p>
		The following ranks are special ranks that you don't see as often, but serve a purpose for specific
		circumstances.
	</p>

	<dl class="row">
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Probation:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			People who have been previously permanently banned, but are being given another chance to redeem their
			self. If this person screws up even once, they will most likely go back to being permanently banned and
			will no longer receive any chances for redemption in the future. It takes a lot to get this rank, you'd
			have to basically try to get it in order to get it.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Temp. Youkai:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has been temporarily granted permission to build in Gensokyo in order to give focus to
			specific projects without actually being a full-fledged builder.
		</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Retired:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">Someone who used to be on the staff team but is no longer.</dd>
		<dt class="col-sm-3 col-md-2">Legendary:</dt>
		<dd class="col-sm-9 col-md-10">
			Someone who has had a large and positive impact on the server and/or the community, but no longer
			regularly participates, sometimes having left entirely.
		</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2 id="staff">Our Staff</h2>
	<div id="staffData"></div>

	<p>
		<strong><span style="font-size: xx-large; color: #ff0000;">DISCLAIMER:</span></strong> Mediators <em>do not</em>
		have authority over builders, they are completely even ranks that do not overpower each other unless it's in the
		category their rank is designed for. If the subject is about building decisions and choices, builders have first
		say. If it's about banning/kicking/rollback/lookups, mediators have first say.
